# UpperManagement
 Upper Management! The very odd but very fun Roguelite platformer!
 
## Its time for a promotion!
In Upper Management, you play as a disgruntled janitor who's blown his last fuse over his working conditions.
He takes it upon himself to "clean up" the management situation, and to take the company down to save his coworkers!

## Current State
This game never really left an early prototype of what gameplay could look like. Sprites are simple, gameplay is basic and there are still bugs (No spiders, yet)
We'll get back around to it eventually, perhaps as some future project to tinker with to keep us all in the same social circle.
